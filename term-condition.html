            <h1>Term and Condition</h1>
            <h3>A. Definitions</h3>
            <p>Thank you for using GitHub! We're happy you're here. Please read this Terms of Service agreement carefully before accessing or using GitHub. Because it is such an important contract between us and our users, we have tried to make it as clear as possible. For your convenience, we have presented these terms in a short non-binding summary followed by the full legal terms.</p>
            <p>Effective date: October 11, 2017</p>
            <p><strong>Short version:</strong> <em>We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.</em></p>
            <ol>
            <li>The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at <a href="#">github.com/site/privacy</a>) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at <a href="#">help.github.com/categories/site-policy</a>.</li>
            <li>The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub.</li>
            <li>The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at <a href="#">github.com</a>, and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as <a href="#">education.github.com</a> and <a href="#">pages.github.com</a>. These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as <a href="#">githubuniverse.com</a>, and product websites, such as <a href="#">atom.io</a>. Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.</li>
            <li>“The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the account; or that directs the use of the account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government accounts (See <a href="#">Section B(4): Additional Terms</a>).</li>
            <li>“GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.</li>
            <li>“Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>B. Account Terms</h3>

            <p><strong>Short version:</strong> <em>A human must create your account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free account. You alone are responsible for your account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your account. You are responsible for keeping your account secure.</em></p>

            <h4>1. Required Information</h4>

            <p>You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a <a href="#l-payment">paid account</a>, in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.</p>

            <h4>2. Account Requirements</h4>

            <p>We have a few simple rules for accounts on GitHub's Service.</p>

            <ul>
            <li>You must be a human to create an account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:<br>
            </li>
            <li>A machine account is an account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free personal account.</li>
            <li>One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).</li>
            <li>You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will <a href="#">terminate that User’s account immediately</a>. If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.</li>
            <li>Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid organization account may create separate logins for as many users as its subscription allows.</li>
            <li>Overall, the number of Users must not exceed the number of accounts you've ordered from us.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>3. User Account Security</h4>

            <p>You are responsible for keeping your account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your account's security, but the content of your account and its security are up to you.</p>

            <ul>
            <li>You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your account (even when content is posted by others who have accounts under your account).</li>
            <li>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.</li>
            <li>You will promptly <a href="#">notify GitHub</a> if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your account, including any unauthorized use of your password or account.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>4. Additional Terms</h4>

            <p>In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.</p>
